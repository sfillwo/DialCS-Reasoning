Speaker (Other): I'm trying to find out more about the history of this area. Specifically, I want to know why it's called Skull Valley.
Listener (You): Okay, I'll see what I can find. According to one website, Skull Valley got its name from an incident that happened in 1866. A group of settlers were attacked by a Native American tribe, and most of them were killed. The only survivor was a woman who found her way back to the settlement and reported what had happened. After that, the settlers named the valley Skull Valley because of what they had seen.
Speaker (Other): That's really interesting! I had no idea that's how it got its name. Do you think we could find any more information about that specific incident?
Listener (You): Yeah, I'm sure we could. Let me see if I can find anything else. This website has a bit more information about the attack. It says that the Native Americans who attacked the settlers were from a tribe called the Paiute. They were upset because the settlers had been taking their land and resources without asking permission or paying for them. Apparently, they tried to warn the settlers to leave before attacking them. After reading this, do you have any thoughts?
